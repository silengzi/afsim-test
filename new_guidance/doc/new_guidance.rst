| This demo directory illustrates the use of the WSF_NEW_GUIDED_MOVER as well as
| the WSF_NEW_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER. A weapon is given the new mover and processor
| to precisely control its fly-out. (The use of "WSF_NEW\_" has been deprecated.)
|
| To run the demos, type "run new_guidance[1-3].txt"

new_guidance1.txt (most complex)
--------------------------------

| Similar to the ship_ad_demo, a weapon is launched from a ship given
| a track from a remote sensor. During missile fly-out, the remote
| sensor platform provides in-flight target location updates to the
| missile. At terminal, a radar sensor on the missile provides final guidance
| to the target.

new_guidance2.txt
-----------------

| Has a jet aircraft use the weapon defined in new_guidance1.txt but
| fires at a pre-briefed track (no sensors).

new_guidance3.txt (least complex)
---------------------------------

| Demonstrates a weapon fly-out that has to go to a lat and lon enroute
| to the target. It does not use the weapon defined in the first two scenarios.
